Please visit www.InfoWeTrust.com to learn about its design and peek behind the scenes.\n\nInspiration\n\nProfiling the Parks was triggered this past April while visiting Yosemite National Park. There is so much to sink your head into there: from the parkitecture of its Grand Lodge to unzipping my tent at sunrise to find two curious coyotes staring right back.\n\nBut admiring the valley from one of its pastures is the experience that really got me. I tried to picture the Yosemite valley compared to Zion, my favorite Park. Yosemite felt taller (it is) and also wider (yup) – but I couldn’t really tell by how much. I also had no idea which park floor was at a higher elevation. This got me thinking beyond the flora and fauna of the park (previously explored here and here) – and into thinking about the land itself.\n\nThis Yosemite spark charged me to revisit previous trips into the American wild: from backcountry hiking the Grand Canyon to glamping in Yellowstone. I wanted to make something that echoed the awe that the Parks inspire – a simple bar chart showing annual visitors would not do. I believed a more passionate approach was more than deserved.\n\nDesign\n\nThe design challenge was to enable effortless “Node A vs Node B” comparison between different landforms. The actual process was pretty messy and very iterative – lots got left on the cutting room floor. Data storytelling is a multidisciplinary craft, and this project blended many tools. The process and tools used were roughly:\n\ndiscover interesting profile cuts by exploring geologic data with digital elevation models: GeoContext, SketchUp create 2D and 3D models (both static and revolving) of these cuts: USGS data, DGI software illustrate models: Koh I Noor woodless pencils, Pigma Ink, Clearprint Vellum, Pastello combine illustrations (keeping scale intact!) and build a narrative: Nikon d800, brother scanner, Adobe PS & AI, Keynote, iMovie, lettering in Procreate. Using both kilometers and miles reflects how I (and other Americans?) think about the land; use metric when we go vertical. The desire to go beyond plants and animals is represented by highlighting the American Buffalo and Giant Sequoia in the opening sequence, which is a play on the National Park System’s 1951 “arrowhead” logo, originally developed by Aubrey Neasham and Herbert Maier.",
