Where is this happening, and can the trend be reversed?","description":"There are 5 species of rhinos spread across 2 continents (Africa and Asia). All of them are in danger of being hunted for their horns. Tensions are high between those who want to legalize the trade of horns to fund local wildlife conservation efforts, and those who fear that legalization would only increase poaching and drive the animals to extinction.\nThis piece will focus on status of African Rhinos (Black and White), which make up ~90% of the global rhinoceros population.
